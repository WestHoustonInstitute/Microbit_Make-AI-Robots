### Explanation: The model is trained to recognize if a person is in the frame or not. If there is a person in the frame the model labels it as Class 1. If there is an empty frame, the model labels it as Class 2. If Class 1: micro:bit shows a checkmark and sounds a melody. If Class 2: micro:bit shows X. You are highly encouraged to go through steps and train your own model for a better accuracy.
